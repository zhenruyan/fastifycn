# nunjucks-markdown-filter

Nunjucks filter for converting a string to markdown using `marked`

### Installation

    npm install nunjucks-markdown-filter

### Usage

Process a string containing markdown:

	 {% set value = "This has **bold**" %}
	 {{ value | md }}
	 // -> This has <strong>bold</strong>

By default, `md` will strip the wrapping `<p>` tags generated by `marked`.  To prevent this, pass `false` as a parameter to the filter:

	 {% set value = "This has **bold**" %}
	 {{ value | md(false) }}
	 // -> <p>This has <strong>bold</strong></p>

Generally, you'll then want to chain the built-in `safe` filter to ensure the HTML doesn't get escaped:

	 {{ value | md }}


### Tests

To run the `jasmine` unit tests:
    npm run test
